*Responsive Portfolio.*

<!-- EDIT the Green -->

<!-- In this challenge we were tasked with the mission of taking existing code and refacting it to a more readable, organized, and clean html and css. I optimized the code by implementing semantic elements and adding applicable attributes and organization. I did so by creating a repository and working website, inputting files in their correct folders, pushing code updates, changing div's to the appropriate semantic element in html & css (header, section, article, & footer), consolidating similar classes into one, inputting markup that highlights different parts of the website, inputting image descriptors, organizing into readable and organized code, creating a ReadMe, and testing for workability and functionality.  -->

<!-- After finishing, the code looks a lot better to me! 
What a great challenge full of many lessons. 

Thanks for checking out my first project on the road to development!  -->
